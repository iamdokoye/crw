## Why Memory Is the Most Underrated Metric in Scraping

When developers compare scraping tools, they focus on features: does it support JavaScript? Does it have an SDK? Does it extract structured data? These matter. But for teams self-hosting scraping infrastructure, memory usage is often the most important practical metric — because it directly determines how much your infrastructure costs.

## The Economics of Idle RAM

Every service you self-host has a fixed memory floor — the baseline RAM consumed before it processes a single request. This "idle memory" is the price you pay just to have the service running.

Consider a team running 10 concurrent scraping workers:

| Tool | Idle RAM per instance | 10 instances | Min server size | Monthly cost (DigitalOcean) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRW | Small static binary | Fits a small node | 1 GB ($6/mo) | $6 |
| Crawl4AI | 300 MB | 3 GB | 4 GB ($24/mo) | $24 |
| Firecrawl | 500 MB | 5 GB | 8 GB ($48/mo) | $48 |

The difference between CRW and Firecrawl for 10 workers: $6/mo vs $48/mo. Over a year: $72 vs $576. For a team running 50 workers: $30/mo vs $240/mo. These numbers compound significantly at scale.

## Why Does Firecrawl Use 500 MB at Idle?

Firecrawl's stack includes Node.js (v8 heap ~50 MB baseline), Playwright (~100 MB), and a Chromium browser instance (~300 MB). Chromium is loaded at startup to avoid per-request browser cold starts. This is a reasonable engineering tradeoff for a service that needs to render JavaScript on every request — but it means you're paying for a full browser runtime even when you're not using it.

## Why Is CRW's Idle Footprint So Small?

CRW is a single static Rust binary with no garbage-collected runtime, no V8 heap, and no pre-loaded browser. Its baseline is just:

- A Tokio async runtime
- An Axum HTTP server
- Connection pools for outbound requests
- Minimal process overhead

When JavaScript rendering is needed, CRW spawns LightPanda on-demand and releases it after the request. Memory scales with actual load, not with the number of idle workers.

## Memory Scaling Under Load

Idle memory is only part of the story. How memory grows under concurrent load is equally important:

| Tool | Idle | 10 concurrent req | 50 concurrent req |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRW | Small static binary | Grows with load | Stays modest |
| Firecrawl | 500 MB | ~700 MB | ~2 GB+ |
| Crawl4AI | 300 MB | ~600 MB | ~1.5 GB+ |

CRW grows roughly linearly with load because each request is handled by a lightweight async task. Node.js and Python services have higher per-request overhead, and browser-based rendering adds significant memory spikes for JavaScript-heavy pages.

## The Sidecar Pattern

One of the most common self-hosting patterns is running a scraping service as a sidecar to your main application — on the same server, sharing resources. This is where memory efficiency matters most.

If your main application uses 1.5 GB of RAM on a 4 GB server, you have 2.5 GB available for the scraping sidecar. CRW fits comfortably and leaves headroom. Firecrawl's idle memory alone would take most of that budget.

The practical implication: CRW can run as a sidecar on virtually any application server. Firecrawl requires a dedicated instance or a significantly larger shared server.

## Memory and Deployment Flexibility

Low memory enables deployment patterns that high-memory services can't support:

**Serverless-adjacent:** Functions with 256 MB memory limits can't run Firecrawl. CRW's binary can be packaged for environments like Fly.io Machines or Railway with tiny memory allocations.

**ARM instances:** Cloud ARM instances (AWS Graviton, Ampere) offer the best price-performance ratio but often have smaller memory options. CRW runs efficiently on 512 MB ARM instances.

**Edge environments:** Running scraping closer to your users reduces latency. Edge compute typically limits memory to 128–512 MB per function. CRW's footprint fits; most alternatives don't.

## When Memory Efficiency Is Less Important

Memory efficiency matters most when you're self-hosting at scale or in constrained environments. In these cases, it's less critical:

- **Low-frequency scraping:** If you scrape 10 pages/day, hosting cost is trivial regardless of tool choice.
- **Managed cloud services:** If you're using Firecrawl's hosted API, you don't pay for their infrastructure directly — you pay per request.
- **Feature requirements outweigh cost:** If you need screenshot capture or document parsing, the memory premium for Firecrawl may be acceptable.

## The Long-Term View

Infrastructure costs are often underestimated in early stages. A $42/month hosting premium seems trivial until your scraping workload scales. At 100 concurrent workers: $60/mo (CRW) vs $480/mo (Firecrawl). Over 3 years: $2,160 vs $17,280.

The memory difference isn't just about current costs — it's about the operational headroom you have to scale without re-architecting your infrastructure.

## Getting Started

Self-host CRW on a $5/month server:

```
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/us/crw:latest
```
